<article>Hello!
<br><br>
My name is Ma≈Çgorzata. In Polish of course. In English it will be Margaret or Margarett if you like doubled-letter.<br>
A few months ago I decided to do something more with my job, with my future (I always loved computers) so today I have courage and I am doing my first step.
<br>
Let's be clear: I know that my English isn't excellent - please forgive me about that - I am still learning. <br>If you see bugs please write to me and I will fix this. It will be a one more lesson for me. Thank you!</article>
